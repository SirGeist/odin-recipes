  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This tastes very close to the taco seasoning favored by a very popular
    fast-food taco restaurant. You can make this at home, and let your family
    prepare tacos the way they like.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons corn flour</li>
    <li>4 ½ teaspoons chili powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a medium bowl, combine the corn flour, chili powder, onion powder,
      garlic powder, and seasoned salt. Stir in the paprika, cumin, garlic salt,
      and sugar. Blend in the onion, bouillon, and ground red pepper, stirring
      until all spices are well blended.

    <li>
      Crumble the ground chuck into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook,
      stirring, until browned. Remove from heat, rinse meat with hot water, and
      drain water and grease from beef.
    </li>
    <li>
      Return meat to skillet, and pour in seasoning. Stir in water. Reduce heat
      to medium-low, and simmer until most of the liquid has cooked away, about
      20 minutes.
